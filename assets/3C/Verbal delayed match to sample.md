- This is a test of short-term memory for verbal or spatial information.
    
- Increasing amounts of information is presented on the screen for a few seconds which the participant needs to study, then after a  delay of a few seconds a single item is presented on the screen. The participant is required to respond whether this item matches any of the items they studied.
    
- Responses are made by pressing a yes or no button. 
    
- Current available versions include one through nine letters as verbal information or one through 36 dots as spatial information.
    
- Task demands are modified using an staircase adaptive difficulty to identify the cognitive capacity of a participant.
