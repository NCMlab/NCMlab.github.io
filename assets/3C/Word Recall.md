# Word Recall
 This is a test of immediate and delayed recall of information testing episodic verbal learning and memory. 
    
- The task repeatedly presents a list of words and asks for immediate recall for multiple trials. A delayed recall trial is presented after completion of approximately ten to fifteen minutes completing other tasks.
    
- Currently, the Rey’s Auditory Verbal Learning Task (RAVLT) version and the Bushke’s selective reminding task (SRT) version are implemented. The RAVLT presents the entire list of words repeatedly, while the SRT only presents words that were not recalled in the previous trial.
    
- Responses are made by an administrator listening to recalled words and clicking buttons on the screen or by speech recognition software eliminating the need for an administrator.
    
- Auditory stimuli are generated using artificial intelligence (AI) technology to create professional quality spoken stimuli in multiple languages, accents, and speeds.
    
- Future directions will implement AI generated actors speaking the stimuli to further simulate  face-to-face administration.
