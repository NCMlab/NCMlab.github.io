This is a test of attention, perseverance, working memory, cognitive flexibility, and set shifting. 
    
- The task presents four cards containing three dimensions: one of four shapes, one of four colors, and between one and four shapes. These four cars stay on the top of the screen throughout the task. A single card is displayed on the bottom of the screen. The participant needs to match this card to one of the above cards based on its item, color, or item count. The participant is not instructed which rule to follow but is given feedback as to whether their choice was correct or not. They therefore need to learn the rule.  The rule changes throughout the task requiring the participant to learn the new rule.
    
- Responses are made by the user touching buttons on the screen.
