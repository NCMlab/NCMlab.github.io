We are located on Lees campus of the University of Ottawa at 200 Lees Avenue in building E.

## Be a student
The lab wouldn't be what it is without students. We encourage HSS4901, the two term honor's thesis project.
We also welcome students to learn more about research through the undergraduate research opportunity program (UROP).

We also welcome graduate students through the [Health Sciences](https://catalogue.uottawa.ca/en/graduate/master-science-interdisciplinary-health-sciences/), [Engineering](https://engineering.uottawa.ca/graduate-programs) and [Psychology](https://socialsciences.uottawa.ca/psychology/) departments.
