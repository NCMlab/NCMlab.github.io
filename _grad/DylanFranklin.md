shortDescr: Dylan is particularly interested in the cognitive changes of aging. Specifically, his PhD is focused on understanding the impact positive and negative emotional affect may have on the working memory abilities of younger and older adults, and how this association may be mediated by cognitive reserve. The neural mechanisms of working memory and cognitive reserve will be assessed using structural and functional brain imaging techniques at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre.
