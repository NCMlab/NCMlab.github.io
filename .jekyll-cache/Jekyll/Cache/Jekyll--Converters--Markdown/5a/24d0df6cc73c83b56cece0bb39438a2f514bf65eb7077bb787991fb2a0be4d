I"¢<p>This package implements ‚Äúprocess‚Äù modeling for functional and structural neuroimaging data and is based off the works by Andrew F. Hayes: http://www.afhayes.com/</p>

<p>One key feature of the current work is that it is written in MatLab for use on a computing cluster without the use of the distributed computing toolbox. The code uses its own map/reduce approach to split the data into small chunks. Bash scripts are written for calling MatLab to operate on each chunk and are then submitted to a cluster using qsub. This approach avoids the requirement for MatLab‚Äôs distributed toolbox which can be quite expensive.</p>

<p>Without the use of a computing cluster these models may not be able to be estimated due to the intense computational time. The large computational time comes mainly from the fact that a large number of voxels (~100,000) are estimated in a typical brain and significance is tested using bootstrapping.</p>

<p>Curremt and future development on this project will translate it into python and will take advantage of larger computer clusters and local GPUs.</p>
