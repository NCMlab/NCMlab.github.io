I"×<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>A fourth-year undergraduate student enrolled in the Health Sciences program. My first introduction to research began in as a volunteer with the OUTLIVE Nutrition Research Lab with Dr Monique Potvin Kent.  As I continued volunteering in Dr. Kentâ€™s research lab, I have gained an informed view into the world of health care related research.</p>

<h2 id="current-project">Current Project:</h2>
<p>My Honourâ€™s project at the NCM Lab falls in the realm of understanding the neural functioning in adults with self-reported cognitive decline while performing different working memory tasks.  Participants in this project will be asked to complete an MRI scan which will help us identify the effects of subjective cognitive complaints on brain activity during neuropsychological tests.</p>
