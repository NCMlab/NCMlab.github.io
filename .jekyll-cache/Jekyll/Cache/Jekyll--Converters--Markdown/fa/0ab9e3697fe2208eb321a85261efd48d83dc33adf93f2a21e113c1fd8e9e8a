I"•<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I was first introduced to the research process through the Scinapse program, where I created a research proposal for a solution to a problem on a given topic. I learned how to navigate through databases, review literature, and design experiments. 
I also participated in the UROP program where I looked at the subjective experiences of individuals practicing various mindfulness meditations, and compiled the data into meaningful themes.
Lastly, I had the opportunity to work in the Translational Medicine department at SickKids hospital, where I learned various lab techniques.</p>

<h3 id="current-project">Current Project:</h3>
<p>I will be doing my Honourâ€™s project at the Neural Cognitive Mapping Lab. I will help with recruiting and testing research participants through different cognitive tasks, including examining brain structure and function using MRI imaging. I am excited to work in a team setting to examine cognitive maintenance and aging, and present the findings through an oral and poster presentation at the end of the year!</p>
