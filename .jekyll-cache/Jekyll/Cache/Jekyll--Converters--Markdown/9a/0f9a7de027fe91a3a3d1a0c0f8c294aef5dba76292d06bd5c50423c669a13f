I"<p>The research interests of the lab focus on generating a more complete understanding of cognitive aging through the integration of multiple neuroimaging modalities, neurocognitive, behavioral and lifestyle assessments.</p>

<p>This research uses a conceptual research model as a systematic guide to explore the multi-faceted effects of advancing age and the role of individual differences on slowing down or accelerating the negative effects of age.</p>

<p>This involves the neuroimaging modalities: task-related functional MRI, resting cerebral blood flow, structure and white matter integrity.</p>

<p>The integration of neural, cognitive and behavioral measures involves univariate, multivariate and structural statistical modeling.</p>

<p>The ultimate goal of this research is the identification of modifiable behaviors that provide protection against age-related pathologies and the mechanism by which such protections operate.</p>

<p>Due to the interdisciplanrity of the lab goals, we have many collaborative and student projects from a broad range of disciplines. This includes health science, psychology, engineering, mathematics and computer science.</p>
