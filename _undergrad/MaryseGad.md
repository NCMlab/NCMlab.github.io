## Background

I was first introduced to the research process through the Scinapse program, where I created a research proposal for a solution to a problem on a given topic. I learned how to navigate through databases, review literature, and design experiments. 
I also participated in the UROP program where I looked at the subjective experiences of individuals practicing various mindfulness meditations, and compiled the data into meaningful themes.
Lastly, I had the opportunity to work in the Translational Medicine department at SickKids hospital, where I learned various lab techniques.

### Current Project:
I will be doing my Honourâ€™s project at the Neural Cognitive Mapping Lab. I will help with recruiting and testing research participants through different cognitive tasks, including examining brain structure and function using MRI imaging. I am excited to work in a team setting to examine cognitive maintenance and aging, and present the findings through an oral and poster presentation at the end of the year!
