name: Collect data on drawing tasks
layout: project
shortDescr: Collect data remotely or in person from drawing tasks using the 3C platform for development of an open-source database of visuo-spatial construction data for future machine learning projects.
---
The 3C platform has multiple drawing tasks which may be performed on a touch screen using a stylus or finger. Drawing tasks evaluate cognitive domains such as visuospatial construction and working memory. Performing these tasks using a computer instead of paper and pencil opens up a lot of novel opportunities. This includes automatic scoring of drawing, extracting additional time measures, assessments of how an image is constructed, etc.

In order to facilitate the development of these novel assessments, a database of completed drawing tasks is required. This project invovles the recruitment and assessment of these tasks in many individuals. Assessment may be performed remotely, in-person, or both. The software collects and stores the images, video-like screenshots of image construction, and the timing of each stroke as images are made. 

REB approval (Project Overview: H-10-23-9755) is already obtained.

## This project involves:
- Understanding the aims/goals of cognitive assessments requiring drawing
- Participant recruitment via social media, flyers, word of mouth
- Data screening, identifying complete data
- Descriptive statistics about the number of people participating split by basic demographics
