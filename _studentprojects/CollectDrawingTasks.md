shortDescr: Collect data remotely or in person from drawing tasks using the 3C platform.

The 3C platform has multipel drawing tasks which may be performed on a touch screen using a stylus. Drawing tasks evalute cognitive domains such as visuospatial construction and working memory. Performing these tasks using a computer instead of on paper opens up a lot of novel opportunities. This includes automatic scoring of drawing, extracting additional time measures, assessments of how an image is constructed, etc.

In order to facilitate the development of these novel assessments a database of completed drawing tasks is required. This project invovles the recruitment and assessment of these tasks in multiple individuals. Assessment may be performed remotely, in-person, or both. The software collects and stores the images, video like screenshots of image construction, and the timing of each stroke as images are made.
