name: Pupillometry (pupil diameter measurements)
layout: project
shortDescr: Incoroprate pupil diameter capabilities into the cognitive assessment platform
---
Much like eye-movements, spontaneous pupil diameter insight into cognitive functioning. Therefore, coupling pupil diameter information into cognitive tasks provides a greater window into cognitive neuroscience than task performance alone. The lab's cognitive assessment platform would be greatly enhanced by incorporating this technology into it. Our platform uses the javascript toolbox: (www.jsPsych.org). 

### This project is to incorporate and test this technology within our platform.
