Much like eye-movements, spontaneous pupil diameter insight into cognitive functioning. Therefore, coupling pupil diameter information into cognitive tasks provides a greater window into cognitive neuroscience than task performance alone. The lab's cognitive assessment platform would be greatly enhanced by incorporating this technology into it. Our platform uses the javascript toolbox: www.jsPsych.org. Packages for
