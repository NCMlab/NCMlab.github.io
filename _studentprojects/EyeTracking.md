shortDescr: Incoroprate eye-tracking capabilities into the cognitive assessment platform
---

Eye-movement behavior during performance of cognitive tasks provides insight into memory, decision-making, and learning. Therefore, coupling eye-movement information into cognitive tasks provides a greater window into cognitive neuroscience than task performance alone. The lab's cognitive assessment platform would be greatly enhanced by incorporating this technology into it. Our platform uses [www.jsPsych.org](www.jsPsych.org) which already includes a package for eye-tracking:

### This project is to incorporate and test this technology within our platform.
