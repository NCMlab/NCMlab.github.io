---
The [3C platform](https://ncmlab.github.io/projects/The%203C%20Platform.html) allows for delivery of cognitive and behavioral assessments. Behavioral assessments are typically performed via questionnaires. Currently, only a small number of questionnaires are available. This project is to implement additional questionnaires to expand the platform's capability. 

 ## This project involves:
 - Identifying important questionnaires
 - Implement the questionnaires into the software
 - Testing to ensure the questionnaires display and are scored correctly
 - Pilot testing on people within the lab
