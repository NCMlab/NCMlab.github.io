name: Automatic Scoring of Paper Based Questionnaires
layout: project
shortDescr: Implement the SDAPS functionaility into the 3C Platform
---
The 3C Platform that was developed in the lab is a web-based tool for adminsitration of cognitive and behavioral assessments. Some of these assessments are digital translations of paper-based tests adminsitered on a tablet computer. While web-based tools have many advantages there are situations in which they are not feasible. This includes scenarios with no internet access or when a participant is not comfortable or able to use a tablet. In such cases the paper-based versions are used as backup. This now raises the issue of inputting the data collected on paper into the digital database. 

This project is to develop printable versions of paper-based assessments which can be easily scannable, digitized via optical mark recognition (OMR), and automatically sent to the database. 

There is an existing open-source package that will facilitate this project:

The optimal complete project would allow a research associate to take a picture of a completed paper questionnaire using their cellphone, send it to a site for processing which then POSTS the results to the database.
