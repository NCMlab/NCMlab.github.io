shortDescr: Implement the SDAPS functionaility into the 3C Platform
---


## This project involves:
The 3C Platform involves the administration of cognitive and behavioral assessments via a computer or tablet. In some scenarios it is not possible to use this digital platform. This may be due to no internet connection, no available digital device, or an inability to utilize the available digital device. In that case, paper versions of the assessments are made available. Assessments that are most ammnable to paper versions are questionnaires or drawing tasks. It is then required to take the paper based assessments and record and enter the responses into the digital database. The current project is to facilitate this process. This will involve making prinatble paper based versions of questionnaires and implementing the tools for transforming scanned completed versions of the questionnaires into data for entry into the database. This is similar to creating customized scantron evaluations. There is an existing package to perform these methods called SDAPS: [[https://sdaps.org/]]
