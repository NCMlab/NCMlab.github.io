layout: project
shortDescr: Develop/implement a tool for the automatic scoring of the hand-drawn clock drawing cognitive test
---
The clock-drawing test is a key assessment usedin demntia diagnosis. The test requires participants to draw an analog clock with the hands pointing to a specific provided time. Scoring needs to be performed by a trained professional. Automatic scoring can greatly improve and expand the use of this important task. The lab's cognitive assessment platform would be greatly enhanced by incorporating this technology into it. Our platform uses the javascript toolbox: (www.jsPsych.org). 

### This project is to incorporate and test this technology within our platform.
