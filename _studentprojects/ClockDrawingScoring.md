name: Develop Automatic Scoring of Drawings
layout: project
shortDescr: Develop/implement a tool for the automatic scoring of the hand-drawn cognitive tests
---

There are multiple drawing tasks used as key assessments in clinical diagnoses. These tests include drawing an image based on a verbal/written description, copying an image, or drawing an image from memory. For all of these tests scoring needs to be performed by a trained professional. Automatic scoring can greatly improve and expand the use of this important class of assessments. The lab's 3C platform would be greatly enhanced through incorporation of this technology. 

## This project involves:
- Understanding/learning about the aims/goals of various cognitive assessments
- Reading the literature to identify appropriate methods 
- Developing tools using local or remote image databases
- Implementing methods into the 3C platform's software
- Programming with JavaScript
