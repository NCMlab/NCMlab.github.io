shortDescr: Develop the software for implementing mediation and moderation statistical analyses with brain imaging data using python.

The core analyses of the lab are those that link together multiple brain imaging modalities with measures of cognitive performance and lifestyles. This is done using mediation and moderation statistical analyses. The lab has a software package to do this, but it is written in MatLab. The problem is that MatLab is not conducive to working on Compute Canada cluster. Therefore, the core functions need to be written in a manner that they can be distributed to a cluster.
