Identify, implement and test cognitive tasks with a wide range of possible task demands. Ideally, a continuous performance task. One idea is a pattern comparison processing speed task with a very wide range of complexity in the patterns. Or a working memory task with a wide range of interference levels and types. There are many possibilities here!
