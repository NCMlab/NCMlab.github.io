[Jason](../../../../jason/jason.html) and [Dylan](../../../../grad/DylanFranklin.html) attended the Reserve and Resilience workshop on research definitions in cognitive aging and dementia on September 9 and 10, 2019. This was the first of three two day workshops bringing together many leaders in the field of cognitive aging to discuss and form a consensus on the definitions of important terms. These terms included brain reserve, cognitive reserve, resilience, maintenance, compensation and others. Each speaker presented their own definitions of the terms they use and then the audience discussed it. The focus of this workshop was on discussion more than speaker led talks. The outcome was a greater familiarity for all on the different terminology. Although the aim of the workshop was consensus, it was clear that we all have a long way to go.
