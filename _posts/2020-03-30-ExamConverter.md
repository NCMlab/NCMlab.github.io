title: Making Exams for Brightspace

With COVID-19 interrupting our lives we have moved to online final exams. Making exams on Brightspace can be done either question by question or using their upload function. I find both situations rather cumbersome. I have exams in a format for printing out, but how do I convert them to Brightspace? I made a little tool to do this. It is written in COLAB so that it can be done completely online and the user (you) can see all the code if you want. Here is a link to the tool which includes a full description.
