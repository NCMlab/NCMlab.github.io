I am in the process of making my online final exams. One concern is how do our best to maintain academic integrity while still providing a good exam. One way is the use of randiomization of the question order and of response order. This is a great approach; however, I wonder how can I have multiple questions on the same topic? For instance, if I provide a reading and have multiple questions about that reading. Brightspace allows the creation of **Categories.**

Categories can be thought of as subsections on the exam. You can then place a series of related questions into the category. Randomization is then done WITHIN the catgory and the order of the categories are shuffled. This allows you to shuffle questions but retain some order.

There is one other issue too, with respect to one question per page. If I have passage to read with multiple questions, how can I do one question per page? The only thing I can think of right now is to copy/paste the passage onto each question text. This is because the Category text only appears for the first question in the category.
