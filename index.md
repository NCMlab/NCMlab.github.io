The goals of the Neural Cognitive Mapping laboratory are to understand how and why cognition declines with advanced age in some, but not all, people. 

Some people live long, cognitively healthy lives even when their brain is experiencing age or disease related neural decline. Such people are described as having cognitive reserve or the ability to maintain healthy cognitive functioning despite the neural declines.. 

The presence of cognitive reserve is linked to higher education, socioeconomic status, physical activity bilingualism and other individual lifestyles and behaviors.

Understanding how cognitive reserve operates and what gives people greater reserves has the potential for a great impact on promoting health as our society ages. 

The goals of this lab are to identify a recipe for life that provide protection of cognitive functioning through the entire lifetime and to understand the neural mechanisms of this favorable situation.

This lab investigates cognitive decline and cognitive reserve using advanced medical imaging measures of brain function, structure and blood flow. 

We integrate neuroimaging, neuropsychology, lifestyles and behaviors (e.g. education and physical activity) into comprehensive models fully linking brain structure, function, cognition and individual differences to test current theories about cognitive aging.

The goals of the lab are addressed using advanced neuroimaging, neuropsychology, statistical modeling, mathematical model, advanced computing and coding.
