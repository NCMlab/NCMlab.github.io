shortDescr: A neuroscientist focused on understanding how some older adults have maintained cognitive performance into late life and why some others are not as fortunate. He combines imaging of brain function and structure, cognitive tasks adapted for each individual and measures of individual differences in how everyone lives and has lived their lives. His approaches use distributed computational power applied to statistical and mathematical models of how advancing age, the brain's structure, the brain's blood flow and how the brain functions to understand cognitive performance.

## Background
 Completed his PhD in Biomedical Engineering at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT), Newark, NJ, USA in 2005 and holds a BSc in Applied Physics and an MSc in Biomedical Engineering, also from NJIT. He joined the Department of Neurology at Columbia University Medical Center, NYC, NY, USA for eight years for a post-doctoral fellowship and continued as faculty. After spending two years as a research scientist at the PERFORM Center at Concordia University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada he joined the University of Ottawa, Ontario, Canada in 2016.
