shortDescr: Implement cognitive protocols into the 3C platform
---
The [3C platform](https://ncmlab.github.io/projects/The%203C%20Platform.html) allows for delivery of cognitive and behavioral assessments. There are many cognitive assessment protocols and cognitive screenings for many different diseases. These are typically collections of tasks with specific parameters. This project is to identify protocals and implement them within the platform. 

## This project involves:
- Understanding/learning about the aims/goals of various cognitive assessments
- Reading the literature to understand protocols for various diseases that affect cognitive performance. 
- Implement cognitive protocols within the platform
- Testing the tools yourself and on labmates to ensure the methods are working
- Pilot testing on people outside the lab
