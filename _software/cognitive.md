It includes tasks of memory, processing speed, fluid ability, verbal intelligence, working memory and executive function. There is also a graphical user interface facilitating adminsitration of the tasks. Each button also features a checkbox so you can easily keep track of what has beeen administered. 

The specific tasks include:
* Selective reminding task, immediate, delayed, recognition
* Stroop color, word and color-word
* Wisconsin card sorting
* North American Reading Task
* Antonyms
* Matrix reasoning
* Pattern Comparison
* Digit span, forward and backward using a staircase adaptive difficulty design
* Letter based delayed match to sample
* Spatial dot based delayed match to sample

The GUI is configurable, through edits to the code, to include or exclude as many tasks as you would like.
