# Single Letter Cancellation Task
Permanent Note
Created: 08-10-2023 13:13


- This is a test used to identify and assess visual scanning deficits and unilateral spatial neglect.
    
- This test requires users to scan a field of letters and cross out a specific one, for instance the letter H in a field containing all letters between A and H. 
    
- The number/density of target and distractor letters is configurable.
    
- Responses are made by touching target letters on the screen, after which they appear crossed out.
    
- Future directions will implement object versions of this task where specific objects (stars) are identified.
