# Ad-hoc Delivery
Delivery of the cognitive and behavioural assessments in a predefined order is appropriate for remote measurements. However, when a clinician is performing assessments face-to-face more flexibility is needed. Therefore, the entire suite of assessments is available to the clinician for use in an ad-hoc manner. This allows the clinician to use their professional judgement in choosing which assessments to administer.
