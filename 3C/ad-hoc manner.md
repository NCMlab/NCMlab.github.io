# Ad-hoc Delivery
When administering cognitive assessments in a face to face office based evaluation, the platform has the flexibility to allow the evaluator to decide what tasks to deliver. In this case the evaluator may decide on which individual tasks to delivery and their order. This allows the evaluator to use their professional judgement in their evaluations. An example screen of this interface is shown below with each figure acting as a button to start the different tasks.
