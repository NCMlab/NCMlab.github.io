# Speech Recognition
The software platform uses [annyang!](https://talater.com/annyang) *"SpeechRecognition that just works."* It performs speech recognition in multiple languages. The use of speech recognition opens the door to a wealth of cognitive testing that has previously been limited to in-person assessments. This includes verbal learning and memory tests involving immediate and delayed free recall. It also includes tests of fluency where someone lists all the words they can think of belonging to a designated category. Speech recognition also opens the doors to conducting remote cognitive assessments with people who may be unable to use a computer and rely on voice commands. 

The speech recognition is cloud based thereby requiring an internet connection to work. However, the software platform includes audio recordings of spoken responses allowing evaluation at a later time.
