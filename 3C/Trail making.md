# Trail Making
This is a test of visual attention, speed of processing, task switching, working memory, and executive functioning.
    
- The participant is required to connect a series of labeled dots together. Dots are connected based on their labels which are either all numbers or numbers and letters. When numbers and letters are presented the participant connects the dots sequentially by alternating between numbers and letters.
    
- Responses are made by drawing lines on a touch screen with either a finger or stylus.
    
- Future directions include a version where the user touches labeled buttons in the correct order instead of drawing on the screen. 
    
- Future scoring possibilities will include the use of the time it takes each person to make each decision, the fluidity of their drawing, and the type of mistakes that they make. This data is available but not currently utilized.
