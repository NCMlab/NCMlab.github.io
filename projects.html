<h2>Student Projects</h2>
The lab is developing an exciting software platform for remote and in-person assessment of cognitive functioning (see description above). 
This platform provides many opportunities for psychology, health science, engineering, computer science, or interdisciplinary student projects.
Here is a list of some of our current needs, but if you have your own idea of something we could use/need we would love to hear about it!
<ul>
  {% for project in site.studentprojects %}
    <li>
      <h4><a href="{{ project.url }}">{{ project.name }}</a></h4>
      <p>
  {{ project.shortDescr }}
</p>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
