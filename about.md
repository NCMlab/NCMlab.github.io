The research interests of the lab focus on generating a more complete understanding of cognitive aging through the integration of multiple neuroimaging modalities, neurocognitive, behavioral and lifestyle assessments. 

This research uses a conceptual research model as a systematic guide to explore the multi-faceted effects of advancing age and the role of individual differences on slowing down or accelerating the negative effects of age. 

This involves the neuroimaging modalities: task-related functional MRI, resting cerebral blood flow, structure and white matter integrity. 

The integration of neural, cognitive and behavioral measures involves univariate, multivariate and structural statistical modeling. 

The ultimate goal of this research is the identification of modifiable behaviors that provide protection against age-related pathologies and the mechanism by which such protections operate. 

Due to the interdisciplanrity of the lab goals, we have many collaborative and student projects from a broad range of disciplines. This includes health science, psychology, engineering, mathematics and computer science. 

Please see the [Projects](../projects/) and [Software](../software/) pages for more details.
