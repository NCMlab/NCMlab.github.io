The use of touch screen technology allows testing of visual motor and executive functioning. Using either their finger or a stylus participants can copy images, draw figures, or draw lines connecting images on a screen. The use of this technology opens up the doors to a wide variety of cognitive assessments further enhancing the validity of remote assessments.

The use of touch screen technology also provides more in-depth measurements of cognitive functioning than paper and pencil can provide. When drawing lines to connect dots or images, touch screen provides measures of how long a person dwelled on an image while looking for the next item in the chain. The software platform also collects sequences of screen captures providing mini-videos of the visual constructions. This allows clinicians to review and evaluate how a task was performed after the fact.
