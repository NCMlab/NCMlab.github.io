This is an open source software platform for the development, administration, and interpretation of in-person and remote behavioural and cognitive assessments. The goal of this platform is two-fold. First, is to democratise access and use of up-to-date cognitive and behavioural evaluations that are supported by demographically appropriate normative data. Second, is to leverage the power of computing to enhance and expand measures collected from cognitive assessments beyond what is traditionally available from paper and pencil administration.
