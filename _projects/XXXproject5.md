name: Development and Validation of a Software Platform for Cognitive and Behavioral Assessments.
layout: project
shortDescr: We have developed a software platform for remote or in-person cognitive and behavioral assessments that incorporates speech recognition, AI generated speech and touch screen technologies. The result is a sophisticated platform for development and deployment of assessments in healthy and disease populations along with a backend interface for interpretation and assessments of participant and patient results.

This is a software platform for in-person and remote behavioral and cognitive evaluation. This software platform is technology-driven, including [AI-generated speech] in multiple languages and accents. It uses [[Speech Recognition]], allowing for free recall and spoken responses. Touch screen technology is used for [[drawing tasks]]. [Questionnaires]({% link Questionnaires.md %})


 and cognitive tasks are delivered within the same platform, facilitating data integration.

The structure of the software platform revolves around a "[[central executive]]"  providing decision making for the platform and communicating with long-term storage. Everything about this platform is [configurable]. This allows for the design of your own [[Battery of Tasks]] or delivery of assessments in an ad-hoc manner. Tasks may be individually tailored to your needs and administrated in multiple languages. Currently, English and French are available.

 The modes of administration include fully remote [[browser-based assessments]], in-person clinic-based cognitive and behavioral screening, or office-based in-depth evaluations. While the software platform is browser-based, it may be administered offline where the internet is not available. In addition to providing testing capabilities, there is an included [[clinical evaluation interface]]. This allows in-depth review of results, clinical annotations, audio recordings, and video screen captures of drawing performance. 

 The intended applications include cognitive research, the development of customized cognitive batteries, and the development of normative databases specific to people and cultures of interest. Finally, this platform allows for remote monitoring of cognitive performance of older adults, thereby facilitating their independence.

Currently, the software platform includes the following [[Assessments and Questionnaires]].
