- This is a test of short-term and working memory.
    
- Numeric stimuli are presented auditorily and the user repeats back the stimuli in the same order (Forward) or the reverse order (Backward).
    
- Responses are made by an administrator listening to spoken recalled digits and typing in responses on the screen, speech recognition software, or the user typing in their response on the screen.
    
- Three different administration and scoring means are currently available. These include presenting a fixed number of trials, administering trials at increasing levels of difficulty until a pre-specified number of errors are made, or an adaptive method where difficulty is varied based on the accuracy of responses. 
    
- Future directions will implement AI generated actors speaking the stimuli to further simulate face-to-face administration.
